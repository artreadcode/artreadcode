Hi, I'm **<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>Suyeon</span>**|suːˈiːən|. (Legal name: 박수연(Suyeon Park), Preferred name: Astryd)

I am a **Creative Quantum Developer** in **Moth** in London. At the same time, I'm studying **MSc Creative Computing** at **University of the Arts London** where I am actively carving the way of creative artworks, quantum computing and neuroscience.
