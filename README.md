Hi, I'm **<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>Suyeon</span>**|suːˈiːən|. (Legal name: 박수연(Suyeon Park), Preferred name: Astryd)

I am now a postgraduate student in **MSc Creative Computing** at **University of the Arts London** where I am exploring the connection between creative artworks, quantum computing and neuroscience.

I was a **student researcher** studying neuro sensors and brain science at **Yonsei University**.

On the side I'm trying to *combine visual experiences with computer programming*, mostly *focused on New media art & Quantum computing*. I'm also *self-studying hard such as Physics and Material science*.

Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:artreadcode@gmail.com), or check out my [website](https://artreadcode.com)(under construction).
