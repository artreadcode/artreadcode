Hi, I'm **<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>Suyeon</span>**|suːˈiːən|. (Legal name: 박수연(Suyeon Park), English name: Astryd)

I'm a **student researcher** studying for neurosensors and brain science at **Yonsei University**.

On the side I'm trying to *combine visual experiences with computer programming*, mostly *focused on New media art & Quantum computing*. I'm also *self-studying hard such like Physics and Matrial science*.

Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:astrydpark@nformare.com), find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/artreadcode), or check out some writings on my [personal blog](https://blog.astrydpark.space).
