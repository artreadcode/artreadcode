Hi, I'm <span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>Suyeon</span>|suːˈiːən|.

I'm a student researcher studying for neurosensors and brain science at <u>Yonsei University</u>.

On the side I'm trying to combine visual experiences with computer programming, mostly focused on New media art & Quantum computing. I also study hard in extracurricular activities such as Physics and Matrial science.

Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:astryd@astrydpark.pro), find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AstrydPark), or check out some writings on my [personal blog](https://astrydpark.pro).
